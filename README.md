# Library_loan_optimization
Today my library decided it was better to send me the book I asked for from the other side of the city instead of just taking the one they had on their shelves. So here I am to proove there was a better way to manage the order.

### Conceptual Steps 

1. read current status
2. get the orders
3. assign the orders
4. simulate returns 
5. update status
